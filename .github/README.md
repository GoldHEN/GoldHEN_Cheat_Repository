### Disclaimer:
While we make every effort to deliver high quality products, we do not guarantee that our products are free from defects. Our software is provided 'as is' and you use the software at your own risk.

### Usage:
- Long press `Share` button in-game to bring up Cheat menu or quick double PS button (depending on the trigger method you choose on GoldHEN settings).
- `↑` / `↓` to highlight cheat.
- `X` to Toggle cheat `On`/`Off`.

### Storage:
- Use `FTP` to upload cheat files to:
  - `/user/data/GoldHEN/cheats/json/`
  - `/user/data/GoldHEN/cheats/shn/`
  - `/user/data/GoldHEN/cheats/mc4/`
- Naming conversion for cheats that attach to eboot.bin process: `{titleid}_{version}.{format}`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.json`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.shn`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.mc4`
- Naming conversion for cheats that attach to a non eboot.bin process (usually on collection games): `{titleid}_{version}_{process}.{format}`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.json`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.shn`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.mc4`
 - **Note:** Only one file format per `titleid` and `version` is currently supported.

### To Do:
- Add multiple cheats support.
- Add more cheat formats.
