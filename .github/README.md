### :warning: Warnings
The Cheat Menu is WIP, use it with caution, we don't develop cheats we only support the compatible formats below.
Please report cheat related issues to the cheat author(s) and/or go to https://github.com/GoldHEN/GoldHEN_Cheat_Repository/discussions/42 and follow the instructions.

### Disclaimer:
While we make every effort to deliver high quality products, we do not guarantee that our products are free from defects. Our software is provided 'as is' and you use the software at your own risk.

### Usage:
- Open a Game then go to the etaHEN toolbox (debug settings) and select the Cheats (WIP) menu option
- `↑` / `↓` to highlight cheat.
- `X` to Toggle cheat `On`/`Off`.

### Storage:
- Use `FTP` to upload cheat files to:
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/json/`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/shn/`
  - `/data/etaHEN/cheats/mc4/`
- Naming conversion for cheats that attach to eboot.bin process: `{titleid}_{version}.{format}`
  - e.g  `PPSA01342_01.004.000.shn` (PS5 example)
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.json`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.shn`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01.mc4`
- Naming conversion for cheats that attach to a non eboot.bin process (usually on collection games): `{titleid}_{version}_{process}.{format}`
  - e.g  `PPSA01342_01.004.000_example.elf.shn` (PS5 example)
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.json`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.shn`
  - e.g. `CUSA001234_01.01_example.elf.mc4`
 - **Note:** Only one file format per `titleid` and `version` is currently supported.

### To Do:
